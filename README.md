  2. Sys admin will create the server to push the code. Ex: Vmware, Open stack, Xen
  3. Build or Release engineer package the application and deploy to the stage or test server
  4. Server admin creates the application server to deploy the code to production server
  All these levels are interrelated and one team should wait on other team to complete the task. This is a manual effort and time taking.
